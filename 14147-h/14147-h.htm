    <p>Gilbert was a little boy who was going to have the first suit of clothes, that
    were not homemade. Wasn't that an event! Gilbert thought so. He was going to the city
    with father and mother to be fitted.</p>
    <p>Mr. Haywood said to his wife. "You'd better take the boy and go with me as far as
    Branton. It's the best place I know of, for fitting out little fellows like him.
    Maybe I can stop over long enough to help you. I'll look up the time-table."</p>
    <p>That's the way it happened that Gilbert and his mother came back to their home at
    midnight. For this story isn't about the hours in the city, it's about the reaching
    home so very late. Maybe you'll like to know, though, that the new clothes were all
    right, and Gilbert was a very happy though a very sleepy boy by midnight.</p>
    <p>But he was wide-awake enough when the cab drew up at their own door, and he heard
    his mother exclaim. "Why, the house is lighted! There's a bright light in the living
    room, and in the dining room too!" Mrs. Haywood had paid the driver and he whirled
    the cab away before she thought. "I do wish I'd asked him to stay, until we could see
    what it means."</p>
    <p>Gilbert was eager to press forward, but his mother put him behind her. She fully
    expected to see burglars searching for silver, or taking money from the desk.</p>
    <p>But the sight which actually greeted her made her drop into a chair and laugh. And
    Gilbert! He threw up his cap, almost shouting. "That's great, isn't it, mother?
    Wasn't it cute of Billikens to light up for us to get in?"</p>
    <p>Now Billikens was a beautiful white Persian kitten, which had come to Gilbert on
    his last birthday, and as full of mischief as a kitten could be. Billikens sat
    perched on the back of an easy-chair under one of the lights, looking for all the
    world as if he tried to say, "I did it, for sure."</p>
    <center>
      <img src='images/illus03.jpg' width='350' height='473'
      alt='Billikens sat perched on the back of an easy-chair.' />
    </center>
    <p>It was this way: Gilbert had often held Billikens up to play with the electric
    light cords, and once when the kitten had pulled just right, the light flashed out.
    Afterward, it became a kind of game to take him round to the brackets, and let him
    light up.</p>
    <p>"I'm afraid we'll have to stop his doing it," Gilbert's mother said. "I doubt if
    you can teach a cat that what is done in play mustn't be done in earnest."</p>
    <p>"That's too bad," Gilbert was quite grieved. "It's such fun to see him put on the
    lights. He almost laughs, himself. We could shut him up if we were away, mother
    dear."</p>
    <p>"Well, perhaps."</p>
    <p>Gilbert was a thoughtful little chap. Now he said, "I learned, didn't I, mother?
    Grandfather liked to have me pull his whiskers when he was awake, but once I pulled
    them when he was taking a nap, and he didn't like it one bit. I never did it after
    that."</p>

    <h3>DILLY AND HER DOUBLE-FACED DOLLY.</h3>
    <br />

    <p>"I think you ought to invite Dilly to your party, Mildred," said Mrs. Fuller. "She
    lives so near us, and you've invited every other little girl on the street."</p>
    <p>"Why," said Mildred, "she'd be sure to bring that dreadful doll that she loves so
    much. Some of the girls wouldn't come if she were invited. You said, mamma, I might
    ask just whom I pleased."</p>
    <p>Mrs. Fuller said nothing more, and the dainty notes of invitation flew here and
    there, but none stopped at Dilly's door. Dilly hardly expected an invitation, but
    there were some bitter tears which fell down on Arabella's face.</p>
    <p>Arabella was the name of one side of her doll. The doll was a crooked-neck squash
    with a stick for its body. It had two faces&mdash;one on each side of its head, and
    ink lines drawn round some of the yellow warts, made very prominent features.</p>
    <p>This doll was the comfort of Dilly's life. The yellow noses were worn quite flat
    with her kisses, and she never had a trouble which was not poured into the two
    sympathizing ears, owned in common by Arabella and Angelina.</p>
    <p>The afternoon of the party came, and Dilly, with her doll, watched the gay little
    folks gather on the lawn in front of Mildred's home. She soon became interested in
    their play, and quite forgot that she was not one of them, in her excitement over a
    game of hide-and-seek. Presently Mrs. Fuller called them for some pleasant surprise,
    and they all ran in, leaving their dolls leaning against the piazza.</p>
    <p>There was nothing more to see. Dilly was gathering up her doll, when something
    made her spring up and cry out.</p>
    <p>Rover, Johnny Cooper's dog, shot past her, barking loudly, his eyes gleaming with
    mischief.</p>
    <p>Rover was the terror of every little girl in the neighborhood. Johnny sometimes
    teased his sisters by sending Rover after their dolls. Rover liked the sport, and
    came to think that dolls were his natural prey. Next to a big bone, there was nothing
    that delighted him so much as to shake a doll to pieces. He had seen the long row of
    dainty little figures, and was dashing towards them. Dilly ran after him, threatening
    and coaxing, but he did not notice her. Then she waved her turkey-red handkerchief,
    and screamed as loudly as she could, to attract someone's attention. But no one
    came.</p>
    <p>Dilly thought of just one thing she could do. A last kiss on Arabella's face, and
    then&mdash;"Rover!"</p>
    <p>The cry sounded so sharp and strange that Rover turned his head. S-w-i-s-h! Right
    down at his side there swooped such a queer-looking doll as Rover, with all his
    varied experience, had never seen. He made a dash for it.</p>
    <p>Dilly darted past him, and, gathering up the dolls, laid them in the hall, and
    shut the door. Her apron was over her face when she went down the walk, but a
    strange, crunching sound told her what had happened to her doll.</p>
    <p>Mildred found Dilly at home a few minutes later, folding away a little, ragged
    doll's cap, and drenching it with tears.</p>
    <p>Mildred put her arms around Dilly's neck. "Oh, Dilly," she said, "it was so
    beautiful of you! Aunt Lou saw it all from the window. I'm so 'shamed to think how
    I've treated you. Do you think you could forgive me? If you could I'd love you all my
    life."</p>
    <p>Dilly forgave her, and, all in her ragged dress, went home with Mildred. Every
    little girl kissed her, and she stopped to tea.</p>
    <p>Not long after, a beautiful doll came to Dilly. It was Mildred's gift, and all the
    little girls who were at the party helped to dress it.</p>
    <p>Dilly loves it dearly, and though it will never take the place of the dear,
    double-faced doll, she is very happy, for Mildred is her loyal friend.</p>

    <h3>WHAT JENNY SHOWED JEAN.</h3>
    <h4>BY ADELE E. THOMPSON.</h4>
    <br />

    <p>It was a happy day for Jean when the cars started that were to take her and Big
    Sister all the way to Grandpa's.</p>
    <p>When they left the train it was just as she had thought it would be. There was
    grandpa waiting to meet them, the ride through the green fields behind Prince, the
    big white house with dear grandma waiting at the door, Tobias the gray cat, the
    speckled hens; all her friends, for grandpa had even opened the pasture gate and let
    Jenny, the pretty Jersey cow, come on the lawn to welcome Jean.</p>
    <p>And Jean! She had hardly taken off her hat before she ran out to see them all. But
    Jenny was her especial favorite, because grandpa had brought her up from a calf and
    she was so gentle that she had let Jean take many a ride on her back. Jean had just
    given her a good hug when grandpa came by leading Prince to pasture. "Please put me
    on her," she begged.</p>
    <p>"All right," he answered. "Take hold of the strap round her neck and don't ride
    far."</p>
    <p>"No, I won't. Jenny always stops for me to jump off when I want to."</p>

    <p>But when grandpa came back there was no little girl, no Jersey cow anywhere to be
    seen. Grandma and Big Sister had been so busy talking that they had not missed her,
    now when they called there was no answer. Where could Jean be?</p>
    <p>But before anyone had time to be really frightened there was a patter of feet and
    Jean herself came running.</p>
    <p>"Oh, oh," she cried, her eyes shining, "what do you think? Just as soon as I was
    on Jenny's back she started for the barn. And when we came round by the barnyard she
    stopped and said 'Moo, moo,' an' then a little calf&mdash;just like Jenny&mdash;that
    I hadn't seen 'cause it was lying down, jumped up, an' came running to the gate an'
    put its head through. Jenny put her head down an' kissed it, then she turned her head
    and looked at me, an' I jumped right down off her back an' kissed it too. For I knew
    it was Jenny's calf an' she had taken me out the first thing to show it to me. Wasn't
    it nice of Jenny to want me to see her calf? an' grandpa, can I name it?"</p>
    <p>Grandpa said he thought it was very nice indeed, of Jenny to show Jean her baby,
    and they had been waiting for her to come and name it.</p>
    <p>"Oh, oh!" cried Jean again, "and I have a name all ready. It is Daisy."</p>

    <p>Rose and Marguerite were playing in the nursery when they heard a queer bumping
    noise down in the back yard.</p>
    <p>"What's that?" asked Rose, stopping to listen.</p>
    <p>"That's Stubby, kicking his heels against the settee. He's awful cross today,"
    said Marguerite, and kept right on making the doll's bed. In a second Rose had her
    head out of the window. There sat Stubby, kicking his heels against the settee and
    looking dreadfully cross.</p>
    <p>"Why, Stubby dear, what's the matter?" she called sweetly.</p>
    <p>"Nuffin'," said Stubby.</p>
    <p>"Why don't you play with the things in the garden?"</p>
    <p>"What fings?"</p>
    <p>"Wait a minute and we'll come down and show you," Rose said, drawing her head
    in.</p>
    <p>"How <i>can</i> you play with that cross, <i>cross</i> Stubby?" asked Marguerite.
    "He isn't sick, and we've done everything to please him all day. He's just plain
    cross. And if you play with him we can't finish arranging the playhouse before five
    o'clock."</p>
    <p>"Mother said I might stay till six," said Rose gently, "and I've thought of
    something to keep him busy. Come!"</p>
    <p>Marguerite gave Rose a bear-hug and soon Stubby saw them coming across the lawn.
    Rose stopped under the apple tree to look for green apples.</p>
    <p>"Muvver says not eat green apples," shouted Stubby.</p>
    <p>Rose held up a little one. "Come on," she called. "Find one the size of that!"</p>
    <p>Stubby became interested in spite of himself, and more so, as Rose began picking
    thorns off the rosebush and sticking them into the apple for eyes, nose and
    mouth.</p>
    <p>Marguerite and Stubby began making one like Rose's.</p>
    <p>"Now, find a stick and push it in for the body," said Rose.</p>
    <p>Stubby rammed one in so hard that it came out at the top of his doll's head.
    "That'll be good to stick a hat to," he said cheerfully.</p>
    <p>"They look pretty thin," said Marguerite holding hers at arms length.</p>
    <p>"But wait till they have clothes on," said Rose happily. "Hollyhocks are fine for
    clothes."</p>
    <p>So Stubby raced off for hollyhocks, picking the short stems off very carefully;
    first the large, silver-white ones, then shell-pink ones and last of all, the dark,
    velvety, red ones.</p>
    <p>"Mine's going to be red," shouted Stubby, running back with his hands full.</p>
    <p>"Then take three, one for the waist and two for the ruffly skirt," said Rose.</p>
    <p>"I know what'll be good for a parasol," said Stubby, sitting down beside Rose.</p>
    <p>"What?" asked Rose.</p>
    <p>Stubby pointed to the morning-glory vine climbing all over the arbor, with its
    pink and violet blossoms rolled tightly up, <i>just</i> like an umbrella! Rose
    clapped her hands.</p>
    <p>"Just the thing," she cried.</p>
    <p>The children next made long braids of hair of striped grass, and fastened them to
    the backs of the dolls' heads with thorns. Then they bound broad sashes of satiny
    grass around the waists and used the flat nasturtium leaves for sailor hats.</p>
    <p>"Now we must begin a house for them to live in," proceeded Rose. "Pick up little
    stones and make squares on the piazza floor for rooms."</p>
    <p>Stubby soon made four rooms, leaving a door in each, with a hall down the
    middle.</p>
    <p>"We can have grape leaves for blankets on the beds, and rose-petals for pillows,
    can't we?" said Stubby excitedly, "and a big, flat stone for a table and little
    stones for chairs!&mdash;and more rose petals for chair cushions!"</p>
    <p>Marguerite was busily pinning a sweet-pea on her doll's head for a bonnet, and
    Rose finished arranging an acorn cup full of tiny green grapes for apples, before she
    replied.</p>
    <p>"Stubby," she said at last, "you're a very clever boy."</p>
    <p>She deftly cut a green apple in two as she spoke, and began hollowing one half out
    with a sharp stick. "This will make a good set-bowl," she said, getting very red in
    the face with so much digging. "Now, Stubby's got the idea, we can go back and
    arrange the playhouse."</p>
    <p>"Oh, I'd rather do this!" cried Marguerite. "We can arrange that playhouse any
    rainy day."</p>
    <p>"Well, if you want to, we'll keep on," said Rose, looking very happy, and giving
    Stubby a bear-hug.</p>
    <p>Stubby didn't usually like being hugged, but this time he hugged Rose back, and
    said, "My doll's name is going to be Rose."</p>

    <h3>THE PRINCESSES AND THE WOOD-CUTTER'S DAUGHTER.</h3>
    <h4>BY JANE WEST.</h4>
    <br />

    <p>When the queen was riding in the forest she met the woodcutter's little daughter,
    and she was so pleased with the child that she invited her to visit at the palace.
    The child, Avis, came the next day, and she was taken up to the royal nursery to play
    with the princesses.</p>
    <p>Before long the children were arguing about what game they should play. Then Rose,
    who was the eldest, remembered her duty to the visitor.</p>
    <p>"What would you like to play, Avis?" she said.</p>
    <p>"I'd like to play whatever the rest of you like," said Avis with her bright
    smile.</p>
    <p>After that the princesses were ashamed to argue about it. They agreed to let
    Mignon, the smallest of them, choose. She chose Ring-around-a-rosy, and they all
    played, and had a great deal of fun.</p>
    <p>When the queen came in for a few minutes Avis remembered to draw up the best
    chair, and place a footstool for her feet.</p>
    <p>All day Avis was so sweet and good-natured that the princesses quite hated to part
    with her. They said good-night, when she went, urging her to come soon again.</p>
    <p>"How does Avis learn to be polite?" Rose asked the queen that night. "She is only
    a poor woodcutter's daughter, and lives in a weed cottage. But she has better manners
    than we, who live in the palace."</p>
    <p>"Why, my child, you have forgotten what politeness is. Mignon, my little one, I
    just taught you yesterday, stand forth and tell your sisters."</p>
    <p>So Mignonette put her hands behind her, and chanted:</p>
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>"Politeness is to do, and say</span><br />
    <span style='margin-left: 2.5em;'>The kindest thing, in the kindest
    way."</span><br />

    <p>"There, children," said the queen, "you see how it is. Politeness comes from a
    kind heart, and it makes a child lovely, and beloved, whether she lives in the hut or
    the palace."</p>

    <h3>THE "BITER'S" WAGON.</h3>
    <h4>By Mary E.Q. Brush.</h4>
    <br />

    <p>I am sorry to say that little Chalmers Ashton was afraid of things! And you know
    there was really nothing to be afraid of, for he lived in a safe, comfortable house
    in the best part of town, and there were father and mother and grandpa and Uncle
    James, Tilly the maid and Billy the hired man to look after him&mdash;to say nothing
    of Mr. O'Brien, the burly policeman in blue coat and brass buttons, who used to
    stroll up and down the street after nightfall.</p>
    <p>But Chalmers used to "imagine things"&mdash;"think them up in his mind." I can't
    begin to tell you just what they were&mdash;only some were like snakes and some had
    horns and sharp teeth and glaring eyes and they growled like everything.</p>
    <p>Chalmers made up a name for them; he called them "The Biters." Awful silly wasn't
    it, to be afraid of made-up things?</p>
    <p>One day an animal show came to the town. For one whole day big white tents were in
    the meadow at the rear of the orchard which belonged to Chalmers' father, and, what
    with the rumbling red and yellow wagons, the noise and confusion, the shouting of the
    men, the roaring of the lions and howling and snarling of the other
    animals&mdash;well, really, it was almost like being next door to a jungle! And it
    was after midnight before everything was packed up and put on board the long train of
    cars.</p>
    <p>Now the show people left one of their smaller wagons behind them; it was a very
    old one and something was the matter with it so that they didn't think it worth while
    repairing. So the next morning, there it stood near the elm tree out in the meadow.
    Then, what do you suppose? Well, it was a very foolish thing to do, but Chalmers got
    it into his head that some of the animals had been left in that wagon!</p>
    <p>"I dare say they are 'Biters,' and maybe, sometime if I go near them, they'll
    pounce out and grab me!" the little boy said to himself, and not a day passed that he
    didn't cast scared glances toward the tattered cover of the wagon. Of course there
    were times when he felt quite brave and actually wanted to peep into the wagon; more
    than once he had visions of what a delightful time he might have with it, making
    believe it was a street car, or playing with it as an omnibus&mdash;but he never
    mustered up enough courage to do this.</p>
    <p>One day as he came home from school he happened to glance at the wagon and his
    heart seemed to jump up into his throat. Surely there was something stirring inside
    that wagon; he saw the canvas cover bulge out&mdash;no, it wasn't the wind fluttering
    it! Besides he was positive that he heard queer noises inside.</p>
    <p>"It's the 'Biters'&mdash;I know it is;" he gasped.</p>
    <p>At first he was tempted to run right into the house, then something inside of him
    seemed to say, "Don't be such a coward, Chalmers! Don't you remember what the teacher
    told you today about General Washington and other brave men?"</p>
    <p>So Chalmers stood still a minute.</p>
    <p>"I'll not be a coward! Besides, there's mother sitting and sewing on the side
    porch."</p>
    <p>So Chalmers climbed over into the meadow and went toward the wagon. When he got to
    the rear of it and peeped in, what do you think he heard and saw? Oh, such a lot of
    chuckles and giggles, and there, seated in a row were his cousins&mdash;plump little
    Marjory, laughing Sharley and cute little Jim!</p>

      <b>There seated in a row were his cousins!</b>
    </center>
    <br />

    <p>"We've come to spend the day with you and we thought we'd hide and surprise you!"
    cried Sharley, while Marjory added. "Oh, isn't this wagon the jolliest old place to
    play in! You must have lots of fun with it."</p>
    <p>"Well, I'm going to have some fun with it now," Chalmers replied as he climbed up
    to take a seat beside her.</p>

    <h3>Ruth's Pretty Dress.</h3>
    <br />

    <p>"My dress <i>is so pretty</i>," said Ruth, smoothing its soft fold and patting her
    own curls as she looked at her pretty reflection in the big mirror. "Yes," said the
    mother, "your dress <i>is</i> pretty, dear, and let mother tell you something about
    how many helped to make your dress.</p>
    <p>"First, a little brown seed baby was put into the ground and it grew up to be a
    plant with flowers on it. Then the flowers dropped off and little green pods came in
    their places. These pods made a nice little house for the seed babies, but when the
    little seeds got ripe they burst their house open and it was all full of soft, white
    cotton. Some little boys and girls picked the cotton out, and then some men put it in
    a machine and took the seed all out of the soft white stuff, and then it went to
    another big house and was made into thread, and then into a beautiful piece of cloth,
    and mother and auntie made your pretty dress out of the seed babies' cotton blanket.
    Isn't it nice that everybody helps Ruthie girl to have pretty things."</p>

    <center>
      <img src='images/illus15.jpg' width='400' height='390' alt='Illustration' />
    </center>
    <p>9. The king went in to the feast to see his guests.</p>
    <p>10. He found one man who showed his disrespect for the king by not wearing his
    wedding garment as he should have done.</p>

    <h3>A Rule That Worked Both Ways.</h3>
    <br />

    <p>It is a poor rule that will not work both ways. At least, so thought Mrs.
    Fletcher, though her son, Ralph Fletcher, did not seem to be of the same opinion
    until he had first tasted some of his own medicine.</p>
    <p>"I wish you would pick up that book, Ralph. You have stepped over it twice and
    have still left it on the floor," Mrs. Fletcher said to her son one morning.</p>
    <p>"I did not drop it, mother; it was Grace," Ralph replied.</p>
    <p>"And because you did not drop it, you think you should not pick it up? It would be
    a very unhappy world, Ralph, if all worked on that principle. However, as you seem
    unwilling to be polite and brotherly, I must ask Grace to place the book on the table
    again."</p>
    <p>A few mornings afterward, Ralph went to his mother, saying:</p>
    <p>"Mother, dear, will you take a stitch in this ball for me? I ripped it playing
    with Frank Danver. Will you do it now? because I'm in a hurry."</p>
    <p>"I did not rip the ball, and so I see no reason why I should mend it," Mrs.
    Fletcher said. "You did the damage; you must repair it."</p>
    <p>"Oh, mother&mdash;" Ralph began, then stopped suddenly.</p>
    <p>"Yes. It is not quite as nice a rule for others to work by, is it, Ralph?"</p>
    <p>"No; and it won't be nice for me after this, if I can help it," Ralph replied with
    a blush.</p>
    <p>After which, one may be sure, the mother's fingers went to work quickly upon the
    ball. But that is a way mothers have, of ever standing ready to give help and
    encouragement to their boys and girls.</p>

collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

1.F.4.  Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you 'AS-IS,' WITH NO OTHER

law of the state applicable to this agreement, the agreement shall be

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/pglaf

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit:
http://www.gutenberg.net/fundraising/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/">http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/etext06/</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.org/dirs/2/4/6/8/24689
